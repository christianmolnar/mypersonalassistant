# AI Robot Fleet Dashboard Design Document
*Version 1.0 - August 10, 2025*

## Overview
This document defines the design specifications for the AI Robot Fleet Master Monitoring Dashboard, following enterprise monitoring best practices with a focus on fleet-scale operations and consistent visual language.

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **"All Green = All Good"**: When all metrics are green, the engineer knows the system is healthy
2. **Consistent Visual Language**: All metrics use identical color coding and thresholds
3. **Coordinated Degradation**: When issues arise, multiple related metrics degrade together
4. **Fleet-Scale Thinking**: Each agent type is treated as a deployable robot fleet
5. **Hierarchical Monitoring**: High-level overview with drill-down capability to robot-class-specific dashboards

### Color Coding Standard (Applied to ALL Metrics)
- **Green**: ≥90% (Healthy operation)
- **Yellow**: 75-89% (Degraded but functional)
- **Orange**: 50-74% (Critical attention needed)
- **Red**: <50% (Immediate intervention required)

```
[TOTAL ROBOTS: 1,650]  [HEALTHY: 1,485 (90%)]  [DEGRADED: 99 (6%)]  [CRITICAL: 50 (3%)]  [DOWN: 16 (1%)]
    (white text)           (color coded)           (color coded)        (color coded)       (color coded)
```

**Metrics Definition:**

| [GREEN] | [GREEN] | [GREEN] | [GREEN] | [GREEN] | [GREEN] |

**Transaction Definitions:**
- **Image Generator**: One complete image generation cycle (prompt → image → delivery)
- **Vinyl Researcher**: One complete research cycle (query → research → results)
- **Communications Agent**: One complete communication cycle (receive → process → respond)
- **Memorias-AI**: One complete processing cycle (audio → transcription → memory storage)
- **Fact Checker**: One complete verification cycle (claim → research → verification)
- **f.insight.AI**: One complete analysis cycle (data → analysis → insights)

**Throughput Thresholds** (to be calibrated based on real agent performance):
- **Green**: ≥90% of baseline throughput
- **Yellow**: 75-89% of baseline throughput
- **Orange**: 50-74% of baseline throughput
- **Red**: <50% of baseline throughput

#### Row 4: Resource Utilization
*CPU and Memory utilization across robot fleets*

|-------------------|---------------------|------------------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| 65% CPU / 70% MEM | 45% CPU / 60% MEM | 35% CPU / 50% MEM | 55% CPU / 65% MEM | 40% CPU / 55% MEM | 50% CPU / 60% MEM |
| [GREEN] | [GREEN] | [GREEN] | [GREEN] | [GREEN] | [GREEN] |

**Resource Thresholds:**
- **Green**: <70% average utilization
- **Yellow**: 70-80% average utilization

- **Red**: >90% average utilization

## Future Dashboard Sections

### Section 2: Business Process Monitoring
*Detailed business metrics and process flows*

### Section 3: Integration Monitoring
*External API and service integration health*

### Section 4: Network Health
*Network performance and connectivity metrics*

### Section 5: Database Health
*Database performance and storage metrics*

## Robot-Class-Specific Dashboards

### Future Deep-Dive Dashboards
Each robot type will have dedicated dashboards for detailed monitoring:

1. **Image Generator Dashboard**: Image generation metrics, model performance, quality scores
2. **Vinyl Researcher Dashboard**: Research accuracy, source diversity, query complexity
3. **Communications Agent Dashboard**: Response times, conversation quality, user satisfaction
4. **Memorias-AI Dashboard**: Transcription accuracy, audio quality, processing stages
5. **Fact Checker Dashboard**: Verification accuracy, source reliability, confidence scores
6. **f.insight.AI Dashboard**: Analysis accuracy, data coverage, prediction quality

## Implementation Notes

### Data Sources
- **Real Agent Metrics**: Use actual performance data from deployed agents
- **Synthetic Fleet Data**: Scale real metrics to simulate fleet-scale operations
- **Blended Approach**: Real agents serve as "pilot instances" within larger synthetic fleets

### Technical Considerations
- All metrics must tie back to real agent capabilities
- Throughput baselines to be established from actual agent performance
- Color coding must be consistent across all dashboard sections
- AlertManager integration for threshold breaches

## Success Criteria
1. Engineer can assess fleet health in <10 seconds
2. All metrics follow consistent color coding
3. Dashboard provides actionable insights for operational decisions
4. Seamless drill-down capability to robot-class-specific details
