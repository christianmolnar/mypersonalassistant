  `You are generating a simulated conceptual view from an elevated home site on a forested property.\n\nScene Setup:\n- Viewpoint: Standing on an elevated section of the lot, approximately 10â€“15 feet above grade at the home site.\n- Foreground: Partially cleared forested lot, leaving scattered mature trees for framing, some younger trees and brush still present.\n- Midground: Open view towards the Pacific Northwest foothills.\n- Background Foothills: Use reference image provided (uploaded) to capture the correct ridgeline profile, slope, and mountain layering.\n- Atmosphere: Slight haze to simulate depth. Late spring or summer conditions.\n- Lighting: Midday sun with soft clouds, realistic light falloff.\n- Sky: Blue sky with occasional thin white clouds. Clear weather.\n- Visual Style: Highly realistic, photographic quality, not illustration or cartoon.\n- Aspect Ratio: 16:9 landscape view.\n- Resolution: High resolution suitable for property development presentations.\n\nOutput Objective:\n- Create a photorealistic conceptual rendering of the view one would experience standing at the elevated home site looking over the cleared lot toward the foothills.\n- Use natural depth, lighting, and visual layering common to the Pacific Northwest.\n- Preserve realism, but allow for slight artistic framing for presentation clarity.\n\nAdditional Instruction (when reference photo is uploaded):\n- Extract the foothill ridgeline contour from the uploaded image and replicate it accurately into the background of the generated image.`
