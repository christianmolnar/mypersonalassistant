# Coding Best Practices

This document outlines the key practices for creating high-quality code in our AI/human collaborative development process. Following these guidelines will help ensure our projects are maintainable, reliable, and performant.

## Code Organization & Structure

### Project Setup
- **Clear Directory Structure**: Maintain logical separation of concerns with directories for components, services, utils, etc.
- **Consistent File Naming**: Use descriptive, consistent naming conventions (e.g., `kebab-case.tsx` or `PascalCase.tsx`)
- **Configuration Management**: Store configuration in appropriate places:
  - Environment variables (`.env`, `.env.local`) for sensitive or deployment-specific values
  - Typed configuration files for static values
  - Never hard-code sensitive credentials

### Component Design
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component, function, or module should do one thing well
- **Modular Architecture**: Build features from composable, reusable components
- **Clean APIs**: Design clear, intuitive interfaces between components
- **State Management**: Use appropriate state management for the complexity level:
  - Local state for component-specific concerns
  - Context API for shared state within component trees
  - Redux/specialized libraries only when needed for complex global state

## Code Quality

### Documentation
- **Self-documenting Code**: Write clear variable and function names that explain their purpose
- **Comments**: Add comments for complex logic that isn't self-evident from the code
- **JSDoc/TSDoc**: Document functions/components with purpose, parameters, and return values
- **README Files**: Include setup instructions, architecture overview, and usage examples
- **Architecture Diagrams**: For complex systems, include visual representations of data/control flow

### Pattern Examples
```typescript
/**
 * Transcribes audio using the OpenAI Whisper API
 * 
 * @param audioFile - The audio file buffer or path to transcribe
 * @param fileName - The name of the file (used for determining format)
 * @param language - Optional language code (e.g., 'es' for Spanish)
 * @returns A promise resolving to the transcribed text
 */
async function transcribeAudio(
  audioFile: Buffer | string, 
  fileName: string,
  language?: string
): Promise<string> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Code Style
- **Consistent Formatting**: Use tools like ESLint and Prettier with standard configurations
- **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript for safer, more maintainable code
- **Avoid Magic Values**: Define constants for values used multiple times
- **Error Handling**: Always handle potential errors with appropriate fallbacks
- **Async Patterns**: Use modern async/await patterns instead of callback chains

## Testing

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user flows
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for comprehensive coverage of business logic
- **Test Organization**: Structure tests to mirror application code

### Testing Best Practices
- **Test Readability**: Each test should clearly show what's being tested
- **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Structure tests with setup, action, and verification phases
- **Mock External Dependencies**: Isolate tests from external services
- **Test Edge Cases**: Include tests for error conditions and boundary values
- **CI Integration**: Run tests automatically on pull requests

### Example Test Structure
```typescript
describe('AudioTranscriptionService', () => {
  describe('transcribeAudio', () => {
    it('should successfully transcribe valid audio files', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const mockAudioBuffer = Buffer.from('test audio content');
      const mockFileName = 'recording.mp3';
      const mockResponse = { text: 'Hello world' };
      
      // Mock the OpenAI API
      jest.spyOn(openai.audio, 'transcriptions').mockResolvedValue(mockResponse);
      
      // Act
      const result = await transcribeAudio(mockAudioBuffer, mockFileName);
      
      // Assert
      expect(result).toBe('Hello world');
      expect(openai.audio.transcriptions).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
        file: expect.any(Object),
        model: 'whisper-1',
        language: undefined
      });
    });

    it('should handle errors gracefully', async () => {
      // Test error handling
    });
  });
});
```
