# [First Name] Annual Rewards [Fiscal Year]

## How to Use This File

To generate the annual rewards evaluation and justification for [First Name], use the following best-practice prompt:

---

**Prompt:**

Using all available Performance_Check-In documents for [First Name] from the current fiscal year ([Fiscal Year]) (including their self-assessment and the manager's impact assessment from the `performance_check_in_feedback` files), generate:

1. **A rewards level evaluation** for the individual, selecting the most appropriate level from the definitions in `rewards_level_definitions.md`. Base your evaluation strictly on the impact, growth mindset, cultural alignment, and business results demonstrated during this fiscal year, as evidenced in both their self-assessment and the manager's impact assessment. If you use a '+' (e.g., 'Significant Impact+'), you must add a section called '## Reasons for +' with short bullet(s) explaining the rationale for the '+'.

2. **A rewards justification** (1500–1800 characters) that clearly explains:
   - The key results and impact the individual delivered this fiscal year.
   - How they demonstrated a growth mindset, met/exceeded Microsoft cultural expectations, and adapted to evolving business priorities.
   - Why the selected rewards level is appropriate, referencing the criteria in the definitions.
   - Any context about their performance trajectory, challenges overcome, and contributions to team or company-wide goals.

**Requirements:**
- Only use evidence from the current fiscal year’s Performance_Check-In documents (employee self-assessment and manager impact assessment).
- Reference the specific criteria and language from the rewards level definitions.
- Be concise, specific, and objective.
- The justification should be suitable for inclusion in a formal annual review.
