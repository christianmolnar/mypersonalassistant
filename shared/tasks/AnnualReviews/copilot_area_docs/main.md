## Annual Rewards Philosophy

High performance has always been expected from every Microsoft employee. Our high-performing ambition unlocks individual and organizational potential and accelerates our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. Performance is defined as impact and is the foundation for awards and promotions. Performance is based on impact, not activity—focus on impact to team, business, and customer results.

This includes individual accomplishments, as well as building on and contributing to the success of others. Think of performance on a spectrum from unsatisfactory to significant to transformational impact, with other levels of impact in between. Determining impact involves several factors. Managers use the manager rewards tool to represent a direct report's impact for the past fiscal year.

Managers consider several factors when evaluating impact, including how direct reports delivered against expectations for their individual core priorities, companywide core priorities, and all three circles of impact.

They also consider:

1. How direct reports demonstrated a growth mindset by taking personal accountability for setbacks, proactively seeking and providing feedback, and applying learnings to achieve greater impact.
2. How direct reports met Microsoft cultural expectations and values for their role, discipline, and career stage, as outlined in the role library.
3. Organizational impact benchmarks established during people discussions.
4. Feedback from multiple sources to minimize potential bias, including connects, one-on-ones, perspectives, and observations over time.

## Understanding Significant Impact

When evaluating impact, consider the most recent full fiscal year. Rewards are not about what was done in the past quarter or over several previous years. Expectations for impact grow year over year. We are all expected to embrace a growth mindset and develop new skills and capabilities to deliver even greater impact each year.

Significant impact corresponds to the midpoint of the performance spectrum. For most employees, this means receiving a 100% annual bonus payout and annual stock award. Delivering significant impact is a strong outcome and indicates high performance. All criteria must be met, reflecting our high expectations for significant impact. This means the employee is expected to deliver significant impact that grows each year. For managers, this means they have met all expectations and may have exceeded some for the manager core priority.

## Understanding Higher Impact Outcomes

Given our high performance expectations, managers should carefully consider outcomes to the right of the midpoint of this spectrum. All criteria for each of these outcomes must be met, and we expect these outcomes to be achieved—and achieved frequently—by those recognized at this level.

When evaluating an employee, if their performance is exceptionally strong within a defined rewards level and they are demonstrating capabilities that are beginning to align with the next level, a '+' suffix (e.g., 'Significant Impact+') may be used. This notation indicates that while the employee is formally at the specified level, their trajectory and strength of impact are noteworthy and could be considered when discussing potential for future advancement or when making a judgment call for a higher reward if their impact is borderline to the next level. This should be used judiciously and supported by specific examples in the justification.

## Index

- [main.md](main.md): This file. Index and summary of all documentation in this area.
- [rewards_level_definitions.md](rewards_level_definitions.md): Definitions for each rewards level, including bonus/stock percentages, categories, and detailed criteria.

## How to use this area

- For each person, generate:
  1. An evaluation of their rewards level (see rewards level definitions, to be provided). Consider using a '+' suffix (e.g., SI+) if performance is strong within that level and could justify consideration for the next level. If a '+' is used, add a section called '## Reasons for +' with short bullet(s) explaining the rationale for the '+'.
  2. A 1500 to 1800 character Rewards Justification, based on their rewards level and the results they have produced in the Performance_Check-Ins for the fiscal year.
