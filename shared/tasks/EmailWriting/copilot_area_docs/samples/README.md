# Email Samples

This directory contains curated examples of well-crafted emails for various situations. Samples are organized into subdirectories by email type.

When contributing a new sample, please:
1.  Create a new subdirectory if a suitable category doesn't already exist (e.g., `MeetingRequests`, `FollowUps`, `FarewellAndThankYou`).
2.  Save the email as a `.md` file within the appropriate subdirectory.
3.  Use a descriptive filename (e.g., `thank_you_to_vp_on_departure_YYYYMMDD.md`).
4.  Consider anonymizing any sensitive information before saving.
