Hello Tara,

First and foremost, I hope things are going well on the family front and the parents are super happy that you and your husband are caring for them and spending time in these tender older years that we are all heading towards.

I know you wonâ€™t see this for a long time, or maybe ever, since your inbox will literally have tens of thousands of emails when you return but could leave without thanking you.  Iâ€™ll shoot you a Teams message as well since that may have a higher chance of reaching you.  

You have been THE most impactful leader in my entire career, even more than Anil, in a different way.  You created a bubble of collaboration and productivity that very few folks get to experience, and it lasted close to 8 years!  I literally have a book in my OneNote, full of learnings and best practices that I want to make sure I follow, and they are going into my GitHub Copilot Personal Assistant.  ðŸ˜Š

CSE will always be my best and most rewarding professional experience.  Iâ€™ll leave it there and paste below the email I sent to Mike, if you want to take a quick read, on the transition front.  The team is obviously in excellent hands.

Best regards,
Christian
