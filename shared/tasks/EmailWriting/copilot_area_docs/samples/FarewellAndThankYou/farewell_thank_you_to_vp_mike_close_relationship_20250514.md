Hello Mike,

Just a quick note to share how incredibly rewarding it’s been to work with you and your team.  I could start naming stuff, but no need.

From the start, my vision was to evolve M365 Communications and bring CCH to the rest of Microsoft.  Azure is a reality, Security Roadmap and Windows coming next.  What an opportunity to create a unified, efficient way for Microsoft to communicate with customers, so we can, as we say, "stop communicating our org chart."  

I'm so excited for what you will do with this little team you are taking on.  They are outstanding folks and a powerhouse.  They get more done than a team double its size and I’m not exaggerating.  Once the dust settles, you'll quickly see that pretty much everyone is a high performer.  Their morale has been through the roof.  It will come back.

The saddest part is that I really was looking forward to working for you.  I know it's unlikely, but I sincerely hope our paths will cross in the not too distant future.

I have no doubt I'll find my next opportunity quickly, but wanted to shamelessly ask two things—would you be willing to be my professional reference? I would truly appreciate it.  And if it's not too much trouble, going down to Recommend Christian and leaving a quick recommendation on my Christian Molnar | LinkedIn Profile.  Obviously, no pressure whatsoever on either.

Wish you the best and will so miss working with you and your awesome team!

Christian
