# Email Tone and Style Guide

## Overarching Tone Principle

**"Write as yourself, with all your good, warm mannerisms and other traits, but as a Vice President in Tech would."**

This core principle encourages a communication style that is:
*   **Authentic and Relatable:** Leverage your natural warmth and positive traits.
*   **Authoritative and Strategic:** Reflect the perspective of a VP, focusing on key issues with clarity and appropriate formality.
*   **Confident and Respectful:** Balance assertiveness with approachability.
*   **Tech-Savvy:** Demonstrate an implicit understanding of tech industry communication norms and context.

## General Email Best Practices

*   **Subject Lines:**
    *   Be clear, concise, and specific. The recipient should understand the email's purpose at a glance.
    *   Examples: "Meeting Request: Project Alpha Discussion," "Action Required: Review Q3 Budget Proposal by EOD Friday," "Following Up: Our Conversation on X."
*   **Salutation:**
    *   Use a professional and appropriate greeting (e.g., "Dear [Name]," "Hi [Name]," "Hello Team,").
    *   Consider your relationship with the recipient.
*   **Opening:**
    *   Get straight to the point, especially for busy recipients.
    *   If it's a follow-up, briefly reference the previous interaction.
*   **Body:**
    *   Organize your thoughts logically. Use paragraphs to separate ideas.
    *   Use clear and concise language. Avoid jargon or overly complex sentences where simpler terms suffice.
    *   Use bullet points or numbered lists for readability when presenting multiple items or steps.
    *   Be mindful of tone â€“ aim for professional, respectful, and constructive. Avoid overly casual language, slang, or negativity.
    *   Proofread carefully for typos, grammar errors, and clarity before sending.
*   **Call to Action (if any):**
    *   Clearly state what you need the recipient to do and by when.
    *   Make it easy for them to respond (e.g., provide necessary links, suggest specific times for a meeting).
*   **Closing:**
    *   Use a professional closing (e.g., "Sincerely," "Best regards," "Regards," "Thank you,").
*   **Signature:**
    *   Include your name, title, and company. Optionally, include contact information or a LinkedIn profile link.
*   **Attachments:**
    *   Mention attachments in the body of the email.
    *   Use clear and descriptive file names.
    *   Consider file size; use cloud storage links for very large files.
*   **Timeliness:**
    *   Respond to emails within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 24-48 hours for non-urgent matters).
    *   If you need more time, acknowledge receipt and indicate when they can expect a full response.
*   **Professionalism:**
    *   Avoid using all caps (can be perceived as shouting).
    *   Use emojis sparingly and only when appropriate for the audience and context.
    *   Be cautious with humor; it can be misinterpreted in writing.
    *   Maintain confidentiality and be mindful of who is CC'd.

## Personalized Mannerisms (Adapted from Connect Style Guide)

While the Connect style is for manager updates, some principles can be adapted for broader email communication, especially when aiming for conciseness and impact with senior audiences:

*   **Audience Awareness:**
    *   Tailor your message to the recipient. For senior leaders or busy colleagues, be exceptionally concise and direct.
    *   Focus on outcomes, impact, and necessary information, not exhaustive process details.
*   **Clarity and Conciseness:**
    *   Prefer direct, fact-based statements.
    *   Minimize narrative and storytelling unless it's essential to clarify impact or context for *that specific email's purpose*.
    *   Use bulleted lists for key points or action items.
*   **Professional Tone:**
    *   Maintain a professional and respectful tone, even when delivering challenging news or making requests.
    *   If a request cannot be met or there's a problem, state it plainly and briefly explain the "why" if appropriate and necessary.

## Specific Scenarios

*   **Thank You / Farewell Emails (Leaving a Job):**
    *   Express gratitude sincerely.
    *   Mention positive experiences or learnings.
    *   Keep it positive and forward-looking.
    *   Offer to stay in touch and provide appropriate contact details.
    *   Refer to `templates/thank_you_leaving_job_template.md` for a starting point.
