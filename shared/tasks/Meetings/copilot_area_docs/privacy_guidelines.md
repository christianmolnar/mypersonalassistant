## Handling Sensitive Content

### Personally Identifiable Information
- Remove or anonymize names of individuals when requested
- Replace personal contact information with role descriptions
- Consider replacing specific names with pseudonyms (Person A, Person B) or roles (Team Lead, Engineer)

### Business Sensitive Information
- Flag financial data, unreleased product information, or competitive details
- Identify information that might be subject to non-disclosure agreements
- Be aware of internal project codenames or identifiers that shouldn't be shared broadly

### Content Sanitization Process
1. Identify sensitive content based on request and context
2. Suggest appropriate redaction or anonymization approach
3. Obtain confirmation before permanently altering sensitive content
4. Document what types of information were removed or modified

## Language Cleanup Guidelines

When cleaning up transcript content:
- Correct obvious transcription errors while preserving meaning
- Organize rambling discussions into coherent topics
- Convert casual language to more formal documentation when appropriate
- Remove filler words, false starts, and repetitions that don't add value
- Maintain the original meaning and attribution of key points
