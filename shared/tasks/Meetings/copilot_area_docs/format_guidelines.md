# Format Guidelines for Meeting Analysis

This document outlines the required formats for different types of meeting analysis outputs.

## Response Format Requirements

When generating analysis of meeting content, the following format should be used:

1. Preserve the original content at the top of the file
2. Add a horizontal rule (---) to separate the analysis
3. Include clear headings for different sections (Summary, Action Items, etc.)
4. Highlight critical information that needs special attention

## Separate File Creation Guidelines

A separate file (rather than adding analysis inline) should be created when:
- The request requires a substantially different format (like a presentation or email)
- The analysis would be lengthy and make the original file unwieldy
- The output is something that stands alone (like formal meeting minutes)
- The creation is something that might need to be shared independently
- Multiple stakeholders need different views of the same meeting
- The request involves combining insights from multiple meeting files

In these cases, confirm if a separate file is preferred before proceeding, and suggest an appropriate filename based on the content type.

## Standard Output Sections

### Executive Summary
- 3-5 bullet points capturing the most important meeting outcomes
- Focus on decisions, major announcements, and overall purpose

### Action Items
- Format: [Owner] Action description - Due date (if specified)
- Clearly indicate any items without a designated owner

### Decisions
- Format: Decision: [The decision] - Rationale: [Why this decision was made]
- Include any noted dissent or concerns

### Questions & Open Issues
- List questions that were raised but not answered
- Indicate who should address each open issue, if known

### Important Dates & Milestones
- Format: Date: Description
- Include both mentioned deadlines and scheduled follow-up meetings
