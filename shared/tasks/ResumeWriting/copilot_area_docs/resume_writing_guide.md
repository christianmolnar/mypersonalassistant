# Resume Writing Guide

This guide provides best practices, tone, and style instructions for creating effective, professional, and authentic resumes. It draws on the tone, mannerisms, and process instructions established in the Email Writing task area, adapted for resume writing.

## Overarching Tone Principle
Write as yourself, with all your good, warm mannerisms and other traits, but as a Vice President in Tech would. Be authentic, confident, and concise.

## Best Practices & Mannerisms (adapted from Email Writing)
- Prioritize clarity, conciseness, and authenticity.
- Highlight impact, outcomes, and measurable results.
- Use a warm, positive, and appreciative tone where appropriate, but remain professional.
- Avoid jargon unless it is industry-standard and adds clarity.
- Use first-person where it adds authenticity, but keep the focus on value delivered.
- When describing leadership, emphasize empowerment, accountability, and team success.
- For technical or business achievements, focus on the problem, your solution, and the outcome.
- When referencing people or teams, be specific and appreciative, but avoid unnecessary name-dropping.
- Use bullet points for clarity and brevity. Use regular dashes for main bullets and indented dashes for sub-bullets for best Word conversion.
- Use `##` before each major section for clarity and to ensure proper heading conversion in Word.
- Avoid unnecessary filler or repetition (YAGNI, KISS, DRY principles).
- Follow the structure and section order recommended in the templates, but adapt as needed for your story.
- **After converting to Word, set the font to Aptos Display, 11pt for normal text, and set all margins to 0.7 inches.**

## Process Instructions
- When creating or reviewing a resume, always consult all relevant samples in the library that match the candidate's background, role, and context. Use these as reference for tone, structure, and content.
- Generate 2-3 headline/summary options for the Professional Profile section and ask the user to pick one before finalizing.
- Reference the functional resume template for section order and content guidance.
- Use [To Enter] for missing dates in experience sections.
- Use a Markdown link for LinkedIn Profile and style as 18pt in Word after conversion.
- Set the font to Aptos Display in Word after conversion (Pandoc cannot enforce this).
- Use HTML span for blue color on Email and Phone (may require manual adjustment in Word).

## Additional Notes
- Resumes should be tailored for the intended audience and role.
- Consider anonymizing sensitive information before sharing or saving.
