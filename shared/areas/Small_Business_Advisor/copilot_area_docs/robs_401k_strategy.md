# ROBS (Rollover as Business Startups) 401(k) Strategy

## What is ROBS?

ROBS allows you to use retirement funds to purchase a business without incurring early withdrawal penalties or taxes. It involves:
1. Rolling over 401(k) funds into a new C-Corporation retirement plan
2. Using those funds to purchase stock in your business
3. The business uses the capital to acquire or start operations

## Legal Structure Requirements

### C-Corporation Formation
- **Must be C-Corp**: S-Corps and LLCs not eligible
- **Stock Ownership**: Retirement plan owns 100% of business stock initially
- **Business Purpose**: Must be legitimate business operations
- **Operational Requirements**: Active business, not passive investment

### 401(k) Plan Setup
- **New Plan**: Create new 401(k) plan for the business
- **Plan Documents**: Proper plan documentation and administration
- **Trustee**: Independent trustee or institution required
- **Compliance**: Annual Form 5500 filings, plan audits if required

## ROBS Process Steps

### Step 1: Business Structure (Week 1-2)
1. **Incorporate C-Corporation** in chosen state
2. **Obtain EIN** for the corporation
3. **Open corporate bank account**
4. **Draft corporate bylaws and resolutions**

### Step 2: 401(k) Plan Creation (Week 2-3)
1. **Design 401(k) plan** with investment in employer stock
2. **Adopt plan documents** and summary plan description
3. **Obtain determination letter** from IRS (optional but recommended)
4. **Set up plan administration** systems

### Step 3: Rollover Process (Week 3-4)
1. **Rollover existing 401(k)** to new business plan
2. **Purchase employer stock** with rollover funds
3. **Capital infusion** into business operations
4. **Document all transactions** for compliance

### Step 4: Business Acquisition (Week 4-12)
1. **Use corporate funds** to purchase business
2. **Transfer business assets** to corporation
3. **Begin business operations** under C-Corp structure
4. **Implement ongoing compliance** procedures

## Financial Considerations

### Costs Involved
- **ROBS Setup**: $5,000 - $15,000 (attorney, CPA, plan administrator)
- **Annual Compliance**: $2,000 - $5,000 (plan administration, audits)
- **Corporate Taxes**: C-Corp taxation on profits
- **Professional Fees**: Ongoing legal and accounting costs

### Tax Implications
- **No Early Withdrawal Penalty**: Funds not withdrawn, just invested differently
- **No Income Tax**: On rollover if done properly
- **Corporate Taxation**: Business profits taxed at corporate rates
- **Double Taxation**: Potential on distributions to owner
- **Payroll Taxes**: Owner must take reasonable salary

### Funding Limits
- **401(k) Balance**: Only existing retirement funds can be used
- **No Additional Contributions**: Limited ability to add more 401(k) funds
- **Other Sources**: May need additional financing for larger acquisitions

## Advantages of ROBS

### Financial Benefits
- **Tax-Free Access**: No penalties or immediate taxes
