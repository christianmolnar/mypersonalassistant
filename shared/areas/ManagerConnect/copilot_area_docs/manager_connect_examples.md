# Manager Connect Examples

> **CRITICAL REMINDER**: As a copilot, your role is never to:
> - Infer impact or assess performance beyond what has been explicitly documented
> - Quantify or rank order examples of impact without verification
> - Make subjective inferences based on communications or meeting notes
>
> For any of these areas, you MUST check with your user
> 
> The examples below assume that all information has been verified with the direct report and is based only on explicitly documented impact or directly observed and discussed behaviors.

This document provides complete examples of well-crafted manager feedback for different Connect sections. Use these examples for inspiration when writing your own feedback for direct reports' Connect documents.

## Core Priority Impact Feedback Examples

### Example 1: Strong Individual Contributor

**Direct Report's Statement:**
> Led the redesign of our customer onboarding process, reducing onboarding time from 14 days to 5 days. Created new documentation and training materials that have been adopted by three other teams. Impact: Customer satisfaction with onboarding increased by 35%, and new customer time-to-value improved by 60%.

**Manager Feedback:**
> Thank you for your exceptional work on redesigning our customer onboarding process. Your methodical approach to analyzing friction points and implementing solutions has delivered significant impact for both customers and the business. The 60% improvement in time-to-value is particularly impressive and has been noted by leadership as a key contributor to this quarter's retention metrics.
> 
> I especially appreciate how you collaborated with the customer success and sales teams to ensure the redesigned process addressed their pain points as well. By creating documentation that other teams have adopted, you've extended your impact beyond your immediate responsibilities.

**Manager Feedback:**
> Your work to expand diverse perspectives in our user research is an excellent example of how inclusion drives better business outcomes. By intentionally seeking input from underrepresented groups and diverse regions, you've uncovered both product improvements and market opportunities that we would have otherwise missed.
> 
> The identification of accessibility issues not only helps us serve users with disabilities better but also improves the experience for all users in challenging contexts. Similarly, the new market opportunities you've identified could significantly expand our customer base in previously underserved regions.
> 
> I appreciate how you've approached D&I not as a separate initiative but as an integral part of doing your core work more effectively. This integrated approach has helped demonstrate the concrete value of diverse perspectives to stakeholders who might have been skeptical.

Implemented immediate mitigation steps and developed a comprehensive remediation plan. Impact: Contained potential exposure within 4 hours with no customer data compromised, and implemented new safeguards to prevent similar incidents.

**Manager Feedback:**
> Your leadership during the potential data exposure incident was exemplary. Your calm, methodical approach to coordinating the response across multiple teams enabled us to contain the issue quickly and prevent any customer data from being compromised.
> 
> I particularly value how you balanced urgency with thoroughness. While moving quickly to implement immediate mitigation steps, you also took the time to understand the root cause and develop a comprehensive remediation plan that addressed the underlying vulnerabilities.
> 
> Your transparent communication throughout the incident, both with leadership and the broader team, helped maintain trust and ensured everyone had the information they needed. The incident response playbook you created afterward has already proven valuable in helping other teams prepare for similar scenarios.
> 
> Looking ahead, I encourage you to partner with the security team to conduct a proactive threat modeling exercise for our key systems, using the insights gained from this incident to identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

## Reflect on a Challenge or Setback Feedback Examples

### Example 1: Learning from Setbacks

**Direct Report's Statement:**
> My approach to the Q2 campaign launch was too siloed. I didn't engage marketing partners early enough, which led to misalignment and rework. I've learned to start cross-functional collaboration at the planning stage, not execution. In our current Q4 campaign, I've established weekly sync meetings with all stakeholders from the start, resulting in better alignment and more efficient execution.

**Manager Feedback:**
> I appreciate your candid reflection on the Q2 campaign launch. Your willingness to own the siloed approach and identify specific changes demonstrates a strong growth mindset. The contrast between the Q2 and Q4 campaign processes shows how effectively you've applied this learning.
> 
> From my perspective, the weekly stakeholder sync meetings you've established have not only improved alignment but have also enhanced the quality of our campaign strategy through earlier diverse input. I've received positive feedback from the marketing team about feeling more integrated into the process.
> 
> This experience highlights your ability to transform challenges into opportunities for improvement. The systematic way you analyzed what went wrong and implemented a specific solution rather than just trying harder is particularly effective.
> 
> As you continue to develop your collaborative approach, consider how you might formalize some of these learnings into a playbook that could help others navigate cross-functional projects more effectively from the outset.

### Example 2: Seeking and Applying Feedback

**Direct Report's Statement:**
> After receiving feedback that my technical explanations were too complex for non-technical stakeholders, I worked to develop more accessible communication approaches. I created layered explanations with executive summaries and supporting details, and practiced with colleagues from different backgrounds. I've since received positive feedback on my presentations to leadership and improved project buy-in from business teams.

**Manager Feedback:**
> Your approach to addressing the feedback on technical communication exemplifies a growth mindset. Rather than becoming defensive or dismissive, you embraced the opportunity to develop a valuable skill that's already showing results in improved stakeholder engagement and project buy-in.
> 
> I've personally observed the evolution in your communication style during leadership presentations. Your ability to articulate complex technical concepts in business terms has notably improved, and I've seen executives engage more actively with your recommendations as a result.
> 
> What impresses me most is the systematic way you approached this development area—creating layered explanations and practicing with diverse colleagues shows thoughtfulness about both the content and delivery of your communication.
> 
> This experience demonstrates your strength in receiving and applying feedback constructively. As you continue to refine your communication skills, consider mentoring other technical team members who may face similar challenges. Your approach could serve as a valuable model for others.

## Lower Impact Than Expected (LITE) Feedback Example

**Direct Report's Statement:**
> Led the implementation of the new customer portal. Coordinated with multiple teams to gather requirements and develop features. Impact: Successfully launched the portal on schedule with all planned functionality.

**Manager Feedback (with LITE indicator):**
> I appreciate your work on the customer portal implementation and recognize the effort involved in coordinating across multiple teams to deliver this project.
> 
> However, I've observed a pattern of lower impact than expected in several aspects of this work. While the portal launched on schedule, customer adoption has been significantly below target (currently at 15% versus our 40% goal), and we've received concerning feedback about usability issues that were not identified before launch.
> 
> The expectations for a project of this importance include thorough user testing before launch, proactive risk identification, and clear adoption strategies—areas where more leadership was needed. When challenges arose during development, a more proactive approach to escalating issues and seeking support would have allowed us to address them earlier.

> For the upcoming period, I need you to focus on strengthening your project management approach in three specific areas:
> 
> 1. User-centered design and testing: Ensure we validate solutions with users before full implementation
> 2. Risk management: Develop a more systematic approach to identifying and mitigating potential issues
> 3. Stakeholder communication: Establish more regular and transparent updates, including early escalation of concerns
> 
> Success will look like: completing your current project with pre-launch user testing that identifies 90% of critical issues, a comprehensive risk register reviewed weekly, and stakeholder feedback indicating clear awareness of project status and challenges.
> 
> I believe you have the capability to strengthen these areas, and I'm committed to providing more regular coaching and review points. Let's meet weekly to review progress and address any obstacles. I've also arranged for you to connect with Sarah, whose project management approach on the billing system update was particularly effective, for additional perspective and mentoring.
