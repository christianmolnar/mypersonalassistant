# Manager Connect Overview

## Critical Limitations of Copilot

Before providing feedback on Connects, it is essential to understand these critical limitations:

**As a copilot, your role is never to:**
- **Infer impact or assess performance** beyond what they have explicitly documented
- **Quantify or rank order examples of impact** without verification from the user
- **Make subjective inferences** based on emails, Teams chats, meeting notes/transcriptions (such as tone, attitude, intentions, work style, and so on)

For any of these areas, you **MUST** check with your user first to ensure accuracy and fairness in your assessment.

## Purpose of Manager Feedback in Connects

Manager feedback is a critical component of the Connect process, providing:

1. **Validation and recognition** of an employee's impact and accomplishments
2. **Additional perspective** that helps employees see their work in the broader context of team and organizational goals
3. **Growth-oriented guidance** that helps direct reports understand their strengths and development areas
4. **Alignment of priorities** to ensure direct reports are focused on work that delivers maximal impact

Effective manager feedback reinforces Microsoft's Performance & Development philosophy by focusing on impact rather than just activities, incorporating diverse perspectives, and supporting a growth mindset culture.

## Key Manager Responsibilities in the Connect Process

As a manager reviewing and providing feedback on your direct reports' Connects, your key responsibilities include:

### Before the Connect Submission

- Ensure direct reports understand the Connect process and expectations
- Encourage direct reports to gather diverse perspectives on their impact throughout the year
- Provide ongoing feedback throughout the year to avoid surprises in the Connect

### During the Connect Review

- Review the direct report's Connect submission thoroughly, focusing on impact across all three circles (individual accomplishments, contributions to others, leveraging others' work)
- Ensure all required core priorities are addressed (including D&I and Security priorities)
- Evaluate impact statements against expectations for the role and level
- Consider perspectives gathered from key stakeholders, partners, and other sources

### Providing Feedback

- Provide specific, balanced feedback that acknowledges strengths and identifies development opportunities

### Connect Conversations

## Evaluating Impact and Growth

When evaluating your direct reports' impact and growth in Connects, consider:

### Impact Evaluation Framework

- **Individual accomplishments**: What has the direct report personally achieved or delivered?
- **Contributions to others' success**: How has the direct report helped others succeed?
- **Leveraging others**: How has the direct report built on the work, ideas, or effort of others?

### Growth Mindset Evaluation

- Has the direct report demonstrated learning from successes and challenges?
- Is there evidence of adaptation and application of learnings?
- Is there accountability and ownership in the reflection?
- Does the direct report show awareness of areas for growth?
