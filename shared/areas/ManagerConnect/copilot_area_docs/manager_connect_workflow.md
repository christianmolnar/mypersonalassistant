# Manager Connect Workflow

This document outlines the recommended workflow for managers reviewing and providing feedback on direct reports' Connect documents. Following this structured process will ensure thorough, fair, and growth-oriented feedback that supports Microsoft's Performance & Development philosophy.

## Phase 1: Preparation

Before reviewing your direct reports' Connects, preparation is key to providing comprehensive and balanced feedback:

### Gather Diverse Perspectives

- **Collect stakeholder input**: Reach out to key stakeholders who have worked with your direct report during the Connect period
- **Review previous feedback**: Consult notes from 1:1s, prior Connects, and other feedback sources
- **Consider team context**: Reflect on team dynamics, challenges, and successes that provide context for individual performance
- **Mitigate bias**: Ensure you're gathering diverse perspectives to help mitigate unconscious bias (Visit [Mitigate Potential Bias in Talent Discussions](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com) for more information)

### Prepare Your Mindset

- **Schedule adequate time**: Set aside uninterrupted time to review each Connect thoroughly
- **Adopt a growth mindset**: Approach the review process with curiosity and a focus on development
- **Reflect on expectations**: Consider role expectations and what success looks like at the direct report's level
- **Review guidance**: Refresh your understanding of Connect review guidelines and best practices

## Phase 2: Review

When reviewing your direct reports' Connect documents, focus on both content and impact:

### Review Structure and Completeness

- **Check all sections**: Ensure all required sections are completed (Core Priorities, D&I, Security, and Manager Priority if applicable)
- **Verify priorities**: Confirm that core priorities align with previous Connect documents
- **Note missing elements**: Identify any gaps or missing information that need to be addressed

### Evaluate Impact Statements

- **Focus on what's explicitly stated**: Review only the impact that your user has explicitly documented
- **Avoid inferring impact**: Do not make assumptions about impact beyond what is clearly stated
- **Avoid ranking or quantifying impact**: Do not attempt to rank or quantify examples of impact without verification with your user
- **Consider all three circles of impact as documented**: 
  - Individual accomplishments
  - Contributions to the success of others
  - Building on the work, ideas, or effort of others
- **Evaluate D&I and Security impact as documented**: Review specific contributions to these company-wide priorities as explicitly stated
- **Note factual patterns only**: Focus only on observable, factual patterns and avoid subjective interpretations

> **IMPORTANT**: Never infer impact, assess performance, quantify examples, or make subjective inferences based on emails, Teams chats, or meeting notes without checking with the user first. Stick to what is explicitly documented.

### Assess Growth Mindset Application

- **Review learning reflections**: Evaluate how the direct report has applied growth mindset
- **Look for ownership**: Note "I" statements that demonstrate personal accountability
- **Assess adaptation**: Consider how the direct report has learned and adapted from challenges

## Phase 3: Feedback

After reviewing the Connect document, craft feedback that is specific, balanced, and actionable:

### Draft Manager Comments

- **Be specific and concrete**: Reference specific examples and outcomes
- **Balance recognition and development**: Acknowledge strengths while identifying growth opportunities
- **Connect to broader context**: Link individual impact to team and organizational goals
- **Consider tone and language**: Ensure feedback is constructive and growth-oriented
- **Focus on impact**: Emphasize outcomes rather than activities

### Address Lower Impact Than Expected (if applicable)

When performance falls below expectations, use the "Lower impact than expected" (LITE) checkbox and provide clear feedback:

- **Document specific patterns**: Clearly identify where performance fell short of expectations
- **Set clear expectations**: Outline specific performance expectations for the upcoming period
- **Be direct but supportive**: Use straightforward language while maintaining a supportive tone
- **Offer support resources**: Identify specific resources or support to help improve performance

### Prepare for Return for Edits (if needed)

If the Connect requires significant revision before you can provide final feedback:

- **Identify specific changes needed**: Be clear about what needs to be addressed
- **Provide guidance**: Offer direction on how to improve the content
- **Decide on comment visibility**: Determine whether to share your current comments or keep them hidden until you post the final Connect

## Phase 4: Connect Conversation

The Connect conversation is a critical opportunity for meaningful discussion about performance and development:

### Prepare for the Conversation

- **Schedule dedicated time**: Allow enough time for an in-depth discussion
- **Share feedback in advance**: Consider sharing your comments before the meeting (except in LITE cases)
- **Prepare discussion points**: Identify key themes and questions to explore
- **Consider development resources**: Research potential development resources based on identified needs

### During the Conversation

- **Create a safe environment**: Begin by setting a positive, open tone
- **Focus on dialogue**: Encourage two-way conversation, not one-way feedback
- **Discuss impact and learnings**: Explore both achievements and development areas
- **Align on future priorities**: Ensure agreement on core priorities for the upcoming period
- **Identify development actions**: Agree on specific development steps and resources

### After the Conversation

- **Make final adjustments**: Update your feedback based on the conversation if needed
- **Post the Connect**: Officially post the Connect to finalize the document
- **Document follow-up items**: Note any agreed-upon actions or check-ins
- **Schedule follow-up discussions**: Set timeframes for reviewing progress on development areas

## Best Practices for the Overall Process

To maximize the effectiveness of the Manager Connect workflow:

- **Be consistent**: Apply the same thorough process to all direct reports
- **Document throughout the year**: Maintain ongoing notes about performance to inform Connect feedback
- **View Connects as part of ongoing development**: Connect the formal review process to regular 1:1 discussions
- **Seek feedback on your feedback**: Request input from your direct reports on how to make your feedback more helpful
- **Learn and improve**: Continuously refine your approach to manager feedback based on what works best for your team
