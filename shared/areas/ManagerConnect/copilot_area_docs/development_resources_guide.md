# Development Resources Guide

> **IMPORTANT LIMITATION**: When identifying development opportunities, Copilot must never:
> - Infer development needs beyond what has been explicitly documented or discussed
> - Make judgments about capabilities without verification with your user
> - Make subjective inferences about learning style or abilities based on communications or meeting notes
>
> Always check with your user before making any such inferences or assessments.
