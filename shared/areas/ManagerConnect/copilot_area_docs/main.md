# ManagerConnect Documentation Overview

This document serves as an index and summary of all files in the ManagerConnect area's copilot_area_docs folder. Use this as your starting point when working on manager-specific Connect-related tasks, and read the linked documents as required for your current task.

> **CRITICAL LIMITATION FOR ALL COPILOT FEEDBACK**:
> 
> As a copilot, your role is never to:
> - Infer impact or assess performance beyond what has been explicitly documented
> - Quantify or rank order examples of impact without verification
> - Make subjective inferences based on communications or meeting notes
>
> For any of these areas, you MUST check with your user first. This limitation applies to all aspects of the Connect process and is reinforced throughout the documentation.
