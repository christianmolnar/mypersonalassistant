# Manager Feedback Template

Use this template as a starting point when providing manager feedback on your direct reports' Connect documents. Customize the content based on your direct report's specific impact, while maintaining a focus on recognition, growth, and forward-looking guidance.

> **IMPORTANT REMINDER**: Copilot is never to:
> - Infer impact or assess performance beyond what has been explicitly documented
> - Quantify or rank order examples of impact without verification
> - Make subjective inferences based on communications or meeting notes
>
> For any of these areas, you MUST check with your user first.
