# Connect Impact Statement Examples

This document provides examples of well-crafted impact statements that you can use as inspiration for your own Connect document. These examples demonstrate how to effectively communicate impact using metrics, specific outcomes, and clear connections to business goals.

## Core Priority Impact Examples

### Individual Accomplishments

✓ **Strong Example:** "Increased customer data set by 12% by establishing mechanisms for our partners and customers."
   - *Why it works:* Includes a specific metric (12%) and clearly explains how the result was achieved.

✓ **Strong Example:** "Led and completed key reviews that resulted in on-time sign-off on approach so we can continue to plan, implement, and deliver improvements for our customers."
   - *Why it works:* Shows leadership role, timely completion, and connects to customer-focused outcomes.

✓ **Strong Example:** "Established a v-team to help identify dependencies and potential risks in Trey Solutions, Wingtip and Brightline projects. Identified over 30 risks and 62 dependencies that weren't previously known and required mitigation plans (preventing at least two known critical escalations)."
   - *Why it works:* Contains specific numbers (30 risks, 62 dependencies) and explains the preventative impact.

### Contributions to Others' Success

✓ **Strong Example:** "Helped global partners reduce inefficiencies by an average of 5% per quarter by sharing issues identified in our systems."
   - *Why it works:* Quantifies the impact (5% per quarter) and explains the mechanism of help.

✓ **Strong Example:** "Created an escalation path for partners across Trey Solutions, Wingtip and Brightline to raise risks and potential blockers efficiently – resulted in 138 issue resolutions all within our 3-day escalation SLA."
   - *Why it works:* Provides specific numbers (138 issue resolutions) and timeframes (3-day SLA).

✓ **Strong Example:** "Expedited alignment and improved the customer experience 4 weeks sooner than expected by helping unblock our partners and create less dependency on our progress for them to move ahead."
   - *Why it works:* Quantifies time savings (4 weeks) and connects to customer experience improvement.

### Leveraging Others and Building on Others' Work

✓ **Strong Example:** "Generated over 35 new insights for this initiative with analytics partners and global team to drive greater inclusion and feedback."
   - *Why it works:* Quantifies output (35 new insights) and shows collaborative effort.

✓ **Strong Example:** "Leveraged our partners to help influence and align their leaders to efficiently get to a go forward decision 2-weeks ahead of schedule, saving $10M in operational costs."
   - *Why it works:* Shows time savings (2 weeks) and quantifies financial impact ($10M).

✓ **Strong Example:** "Created a clear, streamlined taxonomy building off the work of Trey Solutions across multiple workstreams that improved our time efficiency by an average of 4 days and helped reduce interdependencies from three technologies to one."
   - *Why it works:* Details specific time savings (4 days) and technology simplification (3 to 1).

## D&I Core Priority Impact Examples

✓ **Strong Example:** "Completed both the Allyship and Accessibility Learning Paths. These learning paths really helped me understand new ways of thinking and working, and they've helped me re-shape my practices and habits."
   - *Why it works:* Shows specific learning completed and the mindset change that resulted.

✓ **Strong Example:** "I created a proposal to broaden the perspectives shaping our programs, processes, and solutions so that we can gather insights from a wider, more diverse customer base. My proposal was accepted, and the broader customer perspectives provided us with rich data that helped us design our solutions for inclusivity and opened up our products to more people with a wider range of abilities."
   - *Why it works:* Describes a concrete action taken and explains the specific positive outcome.

## Security Core Priority Impact Examples

✓ **Strong Example:** "I have been holding my team accountable for the Security Core Priority, and recognizing them for delivering impact for it. I have also been focused on building psychological safety with my team to make it safe for them to speak up when they identify security opportunities."
   - *Why it works:* Shows leadership in security and connection to psychological safety.

✓ **Strong Example:** "I recently recognized Bridget for her commitment to preventing security issues after completing a project last quarter. She noted that our org's frequent discussions around security and reminders of the importance of security made her feel comfortable with speaking up and coming to me with a potential issue in the project."
   - *Why it works:* Provides a specific example with a named individual and explains the cultural impact.

## Manager Core Priority Impact Examples

✓ **Strong Example:** "Coached Carlos following the re-org after he struggled with his increased workload. Applied 'Coaching Habit' learnings to help Carlos identify the root cause (prioritization) and engage a peer to provide support. This resulted in another team member gaining an opportunity to work on a project aligned with their skills and career interests and re-balanced Carlos' and the team's workload."
   - *Why it works:* Names a specific team member, describes a concrete situation, action taken, and the positive outcome.

✓ **Strong Example:** "Used 1:1s to solicit feedback from my team and asked my manager for a summary of Manager Feedback Tool themes to better understand what's going well and what I can do differently to support my team's success. Prioritization came up as an opportunity area, so I led a prioritization exercise within my team to help align on shared objectives and priorities resulting in agreement to pause lower impact projects for the quarter."
   - *Why it works:* Shows receptiveness to feedback, specific actions taken, and concrete outcomes.

## Growth Mindset Examples

✓ **Strong Example:** "I didn't identify the key stakeholders and their roles as early on as I could have. This caused delays and confusion between our partner teams. I have already applied this learning as I kick-off the next phase of the project and bring in more stakeholders to initiate work on our strategy. I had the v-team go through an exercise where we identified all key roles, their responsibilities, and any potential gaps."
   - *Why it works:* Clearly acknowledges the mistake, explains impact, and details how learning was applied.

✓ **Strong Example:** "Our team was two weeks late on the GNG project deadline and we prevented other teams from hitting a key milestone. If I could go back, I would have spent more time in 1:1s to understand barriers to progress. I could have easily escalated the blocker to our partner teams using my influence to put a higher priority on it. Instead, the project was late."
   - *Why it works:* Takes full responsibility for the missed deadline and specifically identifies missed opportunities to intervene.
