# Connect Overview

## What is a Connect?

A Connect is a structured conversation between an employee and their manager, designed to:

- Reflect on core priorities, impact, and areas of focus going forward
- Identify personal and professional growth opportunities
- Discuss contributions and their impact on the organization
- Align expectations and establish success measures

## Purpose of Connects

Connects serve as a formal framework for career development, performance assessment, and strategic alignment. They provide a dedicated time for substantive discussion about:

- Past accomplishments and their impact
- Areas for growth and improvement
- Future goals and priorities
- Alignment with organizational objectives

## Key Components for Effective Connects

To create an effective Connect, you need to:

1. **Plan thoroughly**: Have genuine discussions with your manager about achieving your core priorities and identifying major goals ("big rocks") for the year.

2. **Document consistently**: Maintain regular records of your impact, collect feedback, and share progress with your manager. Tools like OneNote are recommended for tracking contributions.

3. **Frame appropriately**: Consider your individual phase (e.g., new to the organization, consolidating knowledge, taking on increased responsibility) and use that context to frame your Connect discussions.

## Impact Measurement Framework

When documenting impact in Connects, consider these three interconnected areas:

1. **Individual accomplishments** that contribute to team, business, or customer results
2. **Contributions to others' success** within the team and organization
3. **Results that build on** the work, ideas, or efforts of others

## Growth Mindset

Connects should emphasize a growth mindset, which leads to:
- Embracing challenges
- Persisting through setbacks
- Viewing failures as essential to mastery
- Learning from criticism
- Finding lessons and inspiration in others' successes
