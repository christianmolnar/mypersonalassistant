# Connect Creation Workflow Process

This document outlines the step-by-step process for creating an effective Connect document using GitHub Copilot as your assistant.

## Connect Creation Phases

### Phase 1: Preparation & Information Gathering

1. **Collect Raw Materials**
   - Gather documentation of accomplishments from the past period
   - Locate your previous Connect's "Plan for the Future" section
   - Compile feedback received from colleagues, stakeholders, and managers
   - Review relevant metrics and data that demonstrate impact

2. **Create Project Structure**
   - Set up a dedicated folder for the Connect (named for the relevant year)
   - Place all raw materials into this folder for easy access

### Phase 2: Initial Draft Creation

1. **Generate Raw Connect Plan**
   - Provide GitHub Copilot with raw materials
   - Copilot will organize content into high-level topics aligned with Connect structure
   - Review the initial organization and suggest adjustments

2. **Refine Through Questioning**
   - Copilot will ask clarifying questions about accomplishments and impact
   - Provide additional context or examples as requested
   - Address any gaps identified in the initial organization

### Phase 3: Draft Development & Refinement

1. **Critical Assessment**
   - GitHub Copilot will review the draft from a Career Coach perspective
   - Identify areas where impact could be more clearly articulated
   - Suggest sections that need stronger metrics or examples
   - Highlight opportunities to better align with organizational priorities

2. **Iterative Improvement**
   - Respond to Copilot's suggestions with additional details or clarifications
   - Revise sections based on feedback
   - Ensure SMART principles are applied throughout

### Phase 4: Finalization

1. **Final Review**
   - Copilot will perform a comprehensive review of the Connect document
   - Check for alignment with the Connect structure guidelines
   - Verify that all sections are complete and impactful

2. **Production of Final Version**
   - Generate the final Connect document
   - Format according to organizational standards
   - Prepare for submission and discussion with manager

## Best Practices Throughout Process

### Collaborative Interaction
- Be open to Copilot's questions and suggestions
- Provide specific examples when asked for clarification
- Don't hesitate to redirect if a suggestion doesn't align with your goals

### Documentation Quality
- Maintain focus on impact rather than activities
- Ensure metrics are presented in universally understandable terms
- Keep content concise while preserving important context

### Continuous Improvement
- Document key lessons throughout the Connect creation process
- Note areas where tracking or documentation could be improved for next time
- Update your accomplishment tracking system based on gaps identified
