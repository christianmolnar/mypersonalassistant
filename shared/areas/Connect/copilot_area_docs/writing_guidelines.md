# Connect Writing Guidelines

## SMART Framework for Connect Content

When writing Connect documents, follow this modified SMART system designed for reporting historic accomplishments:

### S - Specific
- Be precise about what you accomplished
- Include detailed descriptions of projects, initiatives, and contributions
- Avoid vague or generalized statements
- Name specific products, tools, or methodologies used

### M - Measurable
- Include quantitative metrics whenever possible
- If metrics aren't available, provide qualitative assessments
- Use percentages, timeframes, or other concrete measurements
- Compare before/after states to demonstrate improvement

### A - Achievable
- Focus on what was actually accomplished, not aspirational goals
- Highlight completed work and delivered results
- Document tangible outcomes rather than ongoing efforts
- Include how challenges were overcome to achieve results

### R - Relevant
- Prioritize the most impactful work
- Connect accomplishments to team, organizational, and company goals
- Focus on work that demonstrates your unique contributions
- Exclude minor tasks that don't showcase significant impact

### T - Time-bound
- Add specific timeframes to each accomplishment
- Note duration of projects or initiatives
- Specify when improvements were implemented and results observed
- Contextual timing can increase the perceived value of accomplishments

## General Writing Principles

### Audience Consideration
- Write with future managers in mind, not just your current manager
- Provide context that allows anyone to understand the significance without deep project knowledge
- Explain metrics in universally digestible ways
- Define acronyms and specialized terminology

### Conciseness
- Keep the document focused and relevant
- Avoid excessive length while maintaining comprehensive coverage
- Prioritize quality of impact over quantity of words
- Use bullet points and concise language

### Clarify Impact
- Always make the impact of your work explicit
- Connect individual contributions to broader organizational goals
- Explain why your work matters and what difference it made
- If impact isn't clear, seek input to better articulate it

## Document Review Process
- Request feedback from peers before finalizing
- Be open to revising and refining your document
- Consider having someone outside your immediate team review for clarity
- Ensure final document balances comprehensiveness with brevity
