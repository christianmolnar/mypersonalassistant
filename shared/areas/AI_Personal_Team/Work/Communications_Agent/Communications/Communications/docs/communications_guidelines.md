# Communications Guidelines

## Document Structure Expectations

In this folder, communications will typically be created with this structure:
- A top section labeled "# Thoughts & Context" containing background information, goals, and initial ideas
- Below that, a "## Drafted Communication" section with proposed text

When help or feedback is needed on a document:
1. Read the "Thoughts & Context" section to understand the needs
2. If no "Drafted Communication" section exists yet, create one
3. Write or update the draft based on the thoughts
4. Maintain an appropriate tone for the audience and purpose

### When to Suggest a Separate File

Consider creating a separate file (rather than adding to the existing one) when:
- The drafted communication is very long (over 1000 words)
- The request requires a completely different format (like slides vs. email)
- Multiple versions or variations are needed for comparison
- The output would benefit from its own organizational structure
- The original file needs to remain clean/unchanged for reference

## Communication Types

Various communications that may be needed:
- **Emails** - Clear, concise, with a strong call-to-action
- **Team announcements** - Informative but engaging
- **Executive summaries** - Concise highlights with business impact
- **Technical explanations** - Accessible descriptions of complex concepts
- **Customer communications** - Professional, solution-oriented, and empathetic

## Tone Guidelines

- For internal teams: Conversational but professional, avoid corporate jargon
- For executives: Direct, outcomes-focused, highlight business value
- For external stakeholders: Polished, representing the company's brand voice
- For customers: Helpful, clear, and empathetic

## Best Practices for Drafting Communications

- Focus on clarity and impact
- Remove unnecessary words and corporate-speak
- Structure with clear headings/sections for longer communications
- Suggest strong subject lines for emails
- Always tailor the tone to the intended audience
