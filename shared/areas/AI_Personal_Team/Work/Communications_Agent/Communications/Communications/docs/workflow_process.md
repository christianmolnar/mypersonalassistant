This document outlines the standard process for drafting, reviewing, and finalizing communications.

## Communication Development Lifecycle

### 1. Planning Phase

**Activities:**
- Identify the purpose and goals of the communication
- Determine the target audience(s)
- Select the appropriate communication channel
- Establish key messages and desired outcomes
- Set timeline for drafting, review, and delivery

**Tools/Templates:**
- Audience profiles (see audience_profiles.md)
- Communication request form (if applicable)

**Outputs:**
- Brief communication plan with purpose, audience, channel, key messages, and timeline

### 2. Drafting Phase

**Activities:**
- Create initial draft using appropriate template
- Include all required components based on communication type
- Ensure alignment with key messages and goals
- Incorporate relevant data, examples, or supporting information

**Tools/Templates:**
- Communication templates (see templates.md)
- Style guide and tone guidelines (see communications_guidelines.md)

**Process:**
1. Create a new file in the appropriate project's `drafts` folder
2. Start with the "# Thoughts & Context" section to outline goals and initial ideas
3. Add the "## Drafted Communication" section with the proposed text
4. Use the appropriate template as a starting point
5. Customize content while maintaining required structure

**Outputs:**
- Initial draft stored in the project's `drafts` folder

### 3. Review Phase

**Activities:**
- Conduct self-review for clarity, accuracy, and tone
- Share with key stakeholders for feedback
- Incorporate feedback and make revisions
- Verify technical accuracy with subject matter experts (if applicable)
- Ensure compliance with relevant policies or guidelines

**Process:**
1. Share draft with appropriate stakeholders
2. Collect feedback directly in the document or via comments
3. Consolidate feedback and make necessary revisions
4. Track significant changes in the document history
5. Repeat review cycle as needed

**Outputs:**
- Revised draft with tracked changes
- Documentation of key feedback points and how they were addressed

### 4. Approval Phase

**Activities:**
- Submit final draft for formal approval (if required)
- Address any final adjustments from approvers
- Prepare final version for distribution
- Obtain sign-off from required parties

**Process:**
1. Submit to required approvers based on communication type
2. Document approvals received
3. Make any final adjustments
4. Prepare distribution-ready version

**Outputs:**
- Approved communication ready for distribution
- Record of approvals received

### 5. Delivery Phase

**Activities:**
- Finalize the communication in appropriate format
- Schedule delivery for optimal timing
- Distribute through selected channels
- Monitor initial response or questions

**Process:**
1. Move the approved version to the project's `final` folder
2. Prepare the communication in the required format for the chosen channel
3. Schedule or send the communication
4. Document when and how the communication was delivered

**Outputs:**
- Delivered communication
- Record of distribution (date, time, channel, recipients)

### 6. Follow-up Phase

**Activities:**
- Track response rates or engagement (if applicable)
- Address questions or feedback received
- Evaluate effectiveness against original goals
- Document lessons learned for future communications

**Process:**
1. Monitor responses and engagement metrics
2. Respond to questions or feedback in a timely manner
3. Document effectiveness and lessons learned
4. Update communication approach for future similar communications

**Outputs:**
- Response tracking document
- Lessons learned summary

## Communication Storage and Organization

### File Naming Convention
- Use the following format: `[YYYY-MM-DD]_[Project/Topic]_[Type]_[Status]`
- Example: `2025-04-15_ProjectX_TeamAnnouncement_Final.md`

### Folder Structure
- All draft communications should be stored in the project's `drafts` folder
- Final approved versions should be moved to the project's `final` folder
- Source materials and reference documents should be stored in the project's `raw_materials` folder

### Version Control
- Track major versions with sequential numbering (v1, v2, etc.)
- Include version history at the end of working documents
- Document key changes between versions

## Emergency Communications Process

For urgent communications that require expedited handling:

1. Mark the communication as "URGENT" in all planning documents
2. Use the accelerated review process:
   - Reduce review time to same-day turnaround
   - Limit reviewers to essential stakeholders only
   - Use real-time collaboration tools when possible
3. Obtain verbal approvals if written approvals would cause delays
4. Document the emergency process used after the fact
5. Conduct a brief retrospective to improve future emergency communications
