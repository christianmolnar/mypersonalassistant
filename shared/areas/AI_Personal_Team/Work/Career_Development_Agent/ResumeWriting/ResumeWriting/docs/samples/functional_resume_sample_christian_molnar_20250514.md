## Professional Profile
Global engineering leader and hands-on technical manager with extensive experience in software design, implementation, engineering management, and technology consulting. Passionate about creating high-performance, reliable, user-centric software while driving product strategy to solve real customer problems and make measurable business impact. Holding active US Government TS/SCI clearance.

## As a Leader
Putting business impact and people’s growth first, I capitalize on people’s strengths and help them work on areas of improvement, so they are not hindrances but remaining true to their personality and style. I motivate by example, creating a culture where everyone truly feels they can do their best work, and where people feel their opinions matter. All this grounded on the reality that the buck needs to stop at the BOL (the person whose butt is on the line), promoting a healthy dynamic of empowerment and accountability.

## At Microsoft

- Evolved M365 Emergency Broadcast System ( https://status.cloud.microsoft ), with a vision of a cross-Microsoft Status source of truth, achieving 99.99% uptime as catastrophic failover for M365 Admin Center.

**Principal Engineering Manager** – Office Release and Delivery Experiences Team – Dec 2014 – Oct 2021  

- Designed and delivered AudienceAPI, introducing Audience-based, Always-On telemetry for Office products, so we could get to know the way our customers use our products and tailor our feature delivery. Patented and in use everywhere in M365 suite of products, not just Office.
- Created Modern Release Orchestration Experiences (MROUI), speeding up Office releases from every 4-6 months to monthly—faster, reliable, and high-quality.

**Principal Group Engineering Manager** – MSN Home Page Worldwide – Jan 2012 – Dec 2014  

- Led the launch of Modern MSN (Windows 8), earning promotion to L66 in one year.
- MSN Ops infra was unreliable with frequent outages. Pitched, designed, implemented, and patented MSN Static Page - EN US.(link to actual, public Static Page for today in English). Page cached for all supported languages once per minute.  Identical to live page, modulo dynamic elements (i.e. Weather, Stocks, etc…) Still in use today.
- Architected and built the Bing Elections 2012 experience in a record 4 months, per Mark Penn’s (Steve Ballmer’s Special Projects VP, Clinton Advisor) question to leadership “You don’t have an Elections Experience?!?!”, scaling to 200M PV’s on Election Day with just 20 web servers by creatively using Static Page model and caching all pages on Akamai, which took the brunt of the load.

**MSN Performance & Reliability Principal Engineering Manager** – Oct 2009 – Jan 2012  

- MSN.com was slow. Page Load Times of over 10 sec! Ads would freeze the page. Users would abandon.
- Architected and implemented MSN.com's page load time (PLT) reduction to <1 sec.
- Pitched and Implemented Ad Impact Testing: Ad creators use AIT to score their ads and receive recommendations on best practices not followed. If they don’t get a passing score, the ad cannot run. VP may override due to ad deal revenue loss potential, but it has transformed the culture very quickly. Patented and in use to this day!

## Prior to Microsoft

**Director, App Services** – CompuCom Excell Data – May 2004 - Feb 2006 

- Built this practice and two others from scratch for 3 different companies.
- Closed and executed dozens of Fortune 500 deals for custom app development, frequently presenting and negotiating with VP (Fortune 500) and C level (Small Enterprise and SMB), with the last engagement before joining Microsoft being the technical execution for code generation and automated and load testing, and all people and project management, helping Lloyd Frink, Richard Barton, and team launch Zillow.com.

**Director of Engineering** – Iship, Inc. – Oct 2000 - May 2004  

- Led development of CMS (Counter Manifest System), acquired by UPS in 2001. This multi-carrier, web-based shipping platform is still UPS' flagship software at counters and stores across the U.S. 
- **The Problem:** Early 2000s, businesses paid high shipping costs with employees picking expensive shipping
- **The Answer:** Install CMS in the mail room. They control default carrier/service.  Most folks use lower cost defaults
- **The Business Impact:** an immediate ~40% reduction in shipping costs
- **The Unfortunate Consequence:** UPS, the market leader, recognized the value and acquired iShip in 2001. While a successful exit for our founder, CMS was locked down to a UPS-exclusive solution. This "little app," built by a team of ~50, has been processing tens of millions of packages every day and through peak times ever since.
