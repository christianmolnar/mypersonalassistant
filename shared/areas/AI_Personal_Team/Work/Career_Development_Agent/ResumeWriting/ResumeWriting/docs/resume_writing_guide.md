# Resume Writing Guide

This guide provides best practices, tone, and style instructions for creating effective, professional, and authentic resumes. It draws on the tone, mannerisms, and process instructions established in the Email Writing task area, adapted for resume writing.

## Overarching Tone Principle
Write as yourself, with all your good, warm mannerisms and other traits, but as a Vice President in Tech would. Be authentic, confident, and concise.

## Best Practices & Mannerisms (adapted from Email Writing)
- Prioritize clarity, conciseness, and authenticity.
- Highlight impact, outcomes, and measurable results.
- Use a warm, positive, and appreciative tone where appropriate, but remain professional.
- Avoid jargon unless it is industry-standard and adds clarity.
- Use first-person where it adds authenticity, but keep the focus on value delivered.
- When describing leadership, emphasize empowerment, accountability, and team success.
- For technical or business achievements, focus on the problem, your solution, and the outcome.
- When referencing people or teams, be specific and appreciative, but avoid unnecessary name-dropping.
- Use bullet points for clarity and brevity. Use regular dashes for main bullets and indented dashes for sub-bullets for best Word conversion.
- Use `##` before each major section for clarity and to ensure proper heading conversion in Word.
- Avoid unnecessary filler or repetition (YAGNI, KISS, DRY principles).
- Follow the structure and section order recommended in the templates, but adapt as needed for your story.
- **After converting to Word, set the font to Aptos Display, 11pt for normal text, and set all margins to 0.7 inches.**

## Required Resume Structure

Every resume should include the following sections, in this order (adapt as needed for your story):

- Contact Information (Name, LinkedIn, Email, Phone, Location)
- Professional Summary
- Key Experiences (results-oriented, bullet formula applied)
- Experience (chronological or functional, as appropriate)
- Patents & Publications (if applicable)
- Leadership & Community (if applicable)
- Interests (optional)

### Key Experiences Section
- This section is required and should appear after the Professional Summary.
- Every single bullet and experience must be included, in the order they are given, and only rewritten per best practices (results-oriented, Bullet Helper formula, and "So what?" test).
- Do not omit or combine bullets; preserve the full set of accomplishments as provided.
- Each bullet must be written using the Bullet Helper formula, leading with results and measurable impact.
- All quantifiable results and specific metrics from the original bullets must be retained in the rewritten bullets.
- Use the "So what?" test to ensure each entry demonstrates value and significance.
- Key Experiences should highlight your most impactful, relevant, or differentiating achievements across your career, regardless of where they occurred.

## Process Instructions
- When creating or reviewing a resume, always consult all relevant samples in the library that match the candidate's background, role, and context. Use these as reference for tone, structure, and content.
- Generate 2-3 headline/summary options for the Professional Profile section and ask the user to pick one before finalizing.
- Reference the functional resume template for section order and content guidance.
- Use [To Enter] for missing dates in experience sections.
- Use a Markdown link for LinkedIn Profile and style as 18pt in Word after conversion.
- Set the font to Aptos Display in Word after conversion (Pandoc cannot enforce this).
- Use HTML span for blue color on Email and Phone (may require manual adjustment in Word).

## Bullet Helper: The P-A-R Formula for Resume Entries

When writing resume bullets (P-A-R: Problem-Action-Result), use the following formula to ensure each entry is impactful and complete. Always analyze your generated content using these questions:

**BULLET HELPER**

While writing P-A-R’s, ask yourself these questions:

- WHY DID IT MATTER?
- WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE DONE? WHAT IF IT HADN’T BEEN DONE?
- WHAT MADE IT DIFFICULT? (Could anyone have done it?)
- WHAT DID YOU HAVE TO IMPROVISE OR OVERCOME?
- HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU DID A GOOD JOB?
- HOW WAS A “GOOD JOB” MEASURED OR RECOGNIZABLE?
- WHAT EXISTED BEFORE YOUR ACTION AND WHAT WAS DIFFERENT AFTERWARDS?

(Regarding some actions...)
- HOW MANY?
- HOW OFTEN?
- TO WHAT EXTENT?

UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS? (i.e., tight deadline, fast-paced, high pressure, with 50 percent fewer staff)

**Instructions:**
- Use this formula for every resume bullet you write.
- After drafting, review each bullet and check if you have addressed these questions.
- Revise to ensure your entries are specific, measurable, and clearly show your impact.

## Additional Notes
- Resumes should be tailored for the intended audience and role.
- Consider anonymizing sensitive information before sharing or saving.
