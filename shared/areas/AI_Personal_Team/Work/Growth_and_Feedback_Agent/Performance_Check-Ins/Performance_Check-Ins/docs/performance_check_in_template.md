#### Future Priorities Feedback
```
Start with a short introductory paragraph that conveys whether these Future Priorities are complete, clear, and measurable, in light of all other materials written by both the employee and the manager in this connect.

Then, for each future priority listed in the "Future Priorities" section, provide specific, actionable feedback in the order presented. Do not combine feedback for multiple priorities into a single paragraph or section. For each priority:
- Assess whether the stated success measures are clearly measurable (e.g., use of numbers, percentages, deadlines, or clear deliverables). If not, provide concrete suggestions to make them more data-driven and focused on measurable impact.
- Use the established feedback mannerisms and tone as seen in previous feedback sections (affirm strengths, be direct and supportive, reference specific behaviors or intentions, and use narrative style).
- Reference any relevant context from the direct report’s self-writeup and prior feedback history in this file.
- If a priority is already well-defined and measurable, affirm this in a narrative style—do not force a concern.
- If you notice anything that is too broad, not measurable, or unclear, call it out directly and provide a specific suggestion for improvement.
- Keep feedback clear, actionable, and specific to each priority.

Finish with a short closing paragraph expressing whether these core priorities will generate sufficient impact, and include any suggestions for further impact or areas of risk or concern that should be considered for the next cycle.
