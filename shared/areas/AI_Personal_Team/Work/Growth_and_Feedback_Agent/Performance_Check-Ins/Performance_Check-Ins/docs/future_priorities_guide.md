# Guide to Writing Effective Future Priorities

This document provides guidance on how to craft compelling, impactful, and measurable future priorities for your Connect document. Future priorities should be specific, measurable, aligned with organizational goals, and demonstrate your strategic thinking.

## Components of Effective Future Priorities

Each of your future priorities should include:

1. **Clear Priority Statement** - A concise description of the priority that immediately communicates its focus
2. **Focus Areas** - Specific aspects of the priority that will drive business impact
3. **Success Measures** - Concrete, data-driven metrics or outcomes that will indicate success. These must be measurable (e.g., numbers, percentages, deadlines, or clear deliverables). Avoid vague or subjective measures.

## Writing Measurable Success Measures
- Use quantifiable targets (e.g., "Increase customer volume by 5% for the quarter" or "Deliver 3 new features by end of Q2").
- Tie success to business impact, not just completion of work (e.g., "Reduce incident response time by 20%" instead of "Complete incident response training").
- If a measure is not easily quantifiable, clarify how progress will be tracked and what evidence will be used to determine success.

## Examples of Well-Crafted Future Priorities
