# Manager Feedback Guidelines

This document provides guidelines for writing effective manager feedback in Connect documents. Following these guidelines will help ensure your feedback is specific, balanced, actionable, and aligned with Microsoft's Performance & Development philosophy.

## Critical Limitations of Copilot

It is essential to understand that as a copilot, your role is **never** to:

- **Infer impact or assess performance** beyond what they have explicitly documented or what has been directly observed and discussed
- **Quantify or rank order examples of impact** without verification from the user
- **Make subjective inferences** based on emails, Teams chats, meeting notes/transcriptions (such as tone, attitude, intentions, work style, and so on)

For any of these areas, you **MUST** check with your user first.

## Key Principles of Effective Feedback

### Be Specific and Impact-Focused

- Focus on measurable impact and outcomes rather than activities
- Reference specific examples, situations, and achievements
- Connect behaviors to business results, customer experience, or team dynamics
- Quantify impact where possible (e.g., metrics, percentages, concrete outcomes)

### Be Balanced and Growth-Oriented

- Acknowledge strengths and areas for development
- Maintain a positive, growth-oriented tone even when addressing challenges
- Focus feedback on behaviors and outcomes, not personality traits
- Emphasize opportunities for growth rather than shortcomings

### Be Actionable and Forward-Looking

- Connect feedback to future priorities and development
- Provide clear guidance on expectations going forward
- Suggest specific development actions or resources where appropriate
- Frame feedback in terms of how it can drive future impact

### Be Aligned with Microsoft's Culture

- Reinforce growth mindset principles and learning from challenges
- Connect individual impact to Microsoft's mission and priorities
- Acknowledge behaviors that demonstrate Microsoft's values
- Recognize contributions to diversity, inclusion, and security priorities

## Writing Effective Feedback for Each Connect Section

### Core Priority Impact Feedback

When commenting on a direct report's impact on their core priorities:

- Validate and reinforce significant accomplishments
- Add additional context on the importance or broader impact of their work
- Highlight the most impactful examples across all three circles of impact:
  - Individual accomplishments
  - Contributions to others' success
  - Building on the work of others
- Note any patterns in how they approach their work
- Suggest areas where impact could be deepened or broadened

Example structure:
```
[Acknowledgment of key impact] + [Additional context or perspective] + [Pattern or approach observation] + [Forward-looking guidance]
```

### D&I Core Priority Feedback

When commenting on a direct report's D&I impact:

- Acknowledge specific D&I actions and their impact
- Connect D&I efforts to business outcomes where applicable
- Recognize behaviors that create inclusive environments
- Suggest opportunities to further broaden D&I impact

Example structure:
```
[Recognition of specific D&I contributions] + [Impact of these contributions] + [Connection to broader D&I goals] + [Future opportunity]
```

### Security Core Priority Feedback

When commenting on a direct report's Security impact:

- Validate security-focused behaviors and practices
- Connect security efforts to customer trust and business resilience
- Recognize proactive security mindset and preventative measures
- Suggest opportunities to further strengthen security practices

Example structure:
```
[Recognition of security contributions] + [Impact on trust and risk reduction] + [Pattern or approach observation] + [Future opportunity]
```

### Reflect on a Challenge or Setback Feedback

When commenting on a direct report's learning and growth:

- Acknowledge learning and adaptation demonstrated
- Validate self-awareness and accountability shown
- Add perspective on learning opportunities they may not have identified
- Connect learning to future growth and impact

Example structure:
```
[Recognition of self-reflection] + [Validation of learning] + [Additional perspective or learning opportunity] + [Connection to future growth]
```

### Future Priorities Feedback

When commenting on a direct report's future priorities:

- Confirm alignment with team and organizational goals
- Add context on the importance of these priorities
- Suggest refinements or adjustments if needed
- Express confidence and support for these priorities

Example structure:
```
[Confirmation of alignment] + [Additional context on importance] + [Specific guidance or refinement] + [Expression of support]
```

## Feedback in Challenging Situations

### Lower Impact Than Expected

When using the "Lower impact than expected" indicator:

- Be clear and direct about performance gaps
- Use specific examples to illustrate patterns
- Focus on behaviors and outcomes, not character
- Set explicit expectations for improvement
- Express confidence in capacity for growth
- Offer specific support and resources

Example structure:
```
[Acknowledgment of efforts] + [Clear statement of gap] + [Specific examples] + [Explicit expectations] + [Offer of support]
```

### Misalignment in Self-Assessment

When your assessment differs significantly from the direct report's self-assessment:

- Acknowledge their perspective respectfully
- Provide specific examples to explain your different perspective
- Focus on observable behaviors and outcomes
- Express confidence in their ability to bridge the gap
- Offer specific guidance and support

Example structure:
```
[Acknowledgment of their view] + [Your perspective with examples] + [Clarification of expectations] + [Specific guidance] + [Offer of support]
```

## Language and Tone Considerations

### Words and Phrases to Use

Effective manager feedback often includes:

- Specific action verbs: "led," "created," "implemented," "resolved"
- Impact terms: "resulted in," "enabled," "improved," "accelerated"
- Growth-oriented language: "opportunity," "development," "learning," "progress"
- Supportive phrases: "I support," "I appreciate," "I'm impressed by," "I've observed"

### Words and Phrases to Avoid

Be cautious with:

- Absolute terms: "always," "never," "completely"
- Vague statements: "good job," "well done," "needs improvement"
- Personality-focused comments: "you are [personality trait]"
- Dismissive language: "failed to," "didn't meet," "inadequate"

## Review and Refinement Process

Before finalizing your feedback:

1. Review for specificity and impact focus
2. Check for balance between strengths and development areas
3. Ensure actionable guidance is provided
4. Verify alignment with Microsoft's culture and values
5. Check tone and language for constructiveness
6. Consider how the feedback will be received and if it sets the direct report up for success
