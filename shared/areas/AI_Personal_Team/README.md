# AI Personal Team: Modular Multi-Agent Productivity Platform

This project is a public, collaborative effort to build a modular, extensible AI-Powered Personal Team of collaborating agents to boost productivity and creativity across work, personal life, health, investments, and more.

## Vision
- Enable anyone to orchestrate and interact with a team of specialized AI agents for various domains (work, life, health, finance, etc.)
- Support both orchestrator and peer-to-peer agent collaboration models
- Provide a web interface for easy user interaction and agent management
- Foster open-source contributions and extensibility

## Structure
- **Agent_Roles_Template.md**: Define agent types, responsibilities, and collaboration
- **Collaboration_Model.md**: Document orchestrator, peer-to-peer, and hybrid models
- **Integration_Points.md**: List APIs, data sources, and security considerations
- **User_Interaction.md**: Specify web interface, notifications, and agent control requirements
- **Extensibility_and_Success.md**: Define how to add new agents/integrations and measure success
- **Plan_of_Action.md**: Outline immediate actions and a phased implementation plan

## Contributing
- Please see the templates in this folder to propose new agents, integrations, or improvements
- Open issues or pull requests for discussion and review

## Next Steps
- Fill in the requirements templates with your specific needs, agent ideas, and integration targets
- Review and refine the architecture and agent roles
- Decide on the initial collaboration model (or experiment with both)
- Begin implementation according to the plan of action

This project is open to all contributors interested in building the next generation of personal AI teams.
