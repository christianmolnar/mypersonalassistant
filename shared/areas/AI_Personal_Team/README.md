# AI Personal Team: Modular Multi-Agent Productivity Platform

This project is a public, collaborative effort to build a modular, extensible AI-Powered Personal Team of collaborating agents to boost productivity and creativity across work, personal life, health, investments, and more.

## Vision
- Enable anyone to orchestrate and interact with a team of specialized AI agents for various domains (work, life, health, finance, etc.)
- Support both orchestrator and peer-to-peer agent collaboration models
- Provide a web interface for easy user interaction and agent management
- Foster open-source contributions and extensibility

## Structure
- **docs/**: Documentation, templates, and guides for this area
- **Agent_Roles_Template.md**: Define agent types, responsibilities, and collaboration
- **Collaboration_Model.md**: Document orchestrator, peer-to-peer, and hybrid models
- **Integration_Points.md**: List APIs, data sources, and security considerations
- **User_Interaction.md**: Specify web interface, notifications, and agent control requirements
- **Extensibility_and_Success.md**: Define how to add new agents/integrations and measure success
- **Plan_of_Action.md**: Outline immediate actions and a phased implementation plan

## How to Use Your Personal Folder

### Permanent Memory
Store all personal notes, drafts, interview prep, portfolio materials, and working documents here. This provides context for your agents and keeps your private data out of the shared repo.

### Personalization
Agents can be designed to read from your personal folders (with your permission) to provide more personalized responses, summaries, or automations.

### No Need to Mirror Shared Structure
Organize by topic, project, or workflowâ€”whatever is most useful for you. Only create agent-specific folders if you want to keep agent-related personal data separate.

## Agent Roles & Capabilities Template

Use this template to define each agent you envision (Scheduler, Researcher, Health Coach, etc.):

### Agent Name
- Description:
- Primary Responsibilities:
- Required Skills/Technologies:
- Data/Systems Access Needed:
- Example Use Cases:

### Collaboration & Communication
- How does this agent interact with others?
- What triggers its actions?
- What outputs/results does it produce?

## Contributing
- Please see the templates and docs in this folder to propose new agents, integrations, or improvements
- Open issues or pull requests for discussion and review

## Next Steps
- Fill in the requirements templates and docs with your specific needs, agent ideas, and integration targets
- Review and refine the architecture and agent roles
- Decide on the initial collaboration model (or experiment with both)
- Begin implementation according to the plan of action

This project is open to all contributors interested in building the next generation of personal AI teams.
