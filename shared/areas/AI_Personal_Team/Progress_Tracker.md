## Step-by-Step Plan and Progress Tracker

### 1. Requirements & Architecture
- ✅ Define agent roles, responsibilities, and abilities
  - Notes: Complete
- ✅ Map areas/tasks to agents
  - Notes: Complete
- ✅ Document collaboration models and integration points
  - Notes: Complete
- ✅ Organize shared and personal folder structures
  - Notes: Complete

### 2. Project Scaffolding
- ✅ Create agent folders and move tasks/areas under Work/Personal
  - Notes: Complete
- ✅ Clean up legacy and duplicate files
  - Notes: Complete
- ✅ Consolidate agent definitions into Agent_Abilities_Library.md
  - Notes: Complete

### 3. Codebase Bootstrapping
- ✅ Choose tech stack (Python, TypeScript, etc.)
  - Notes: Chosen stack: TypeScript/Node.js backend with REST API, React web frontend, and optional React Native for mobile app. Prioritize web interface and API integration first; plan for future ChatGPT/Assistant and external API (e.g., Schwab) integration.
- ⭕ Scaffold agent base classes and interfaces
- ⭕ Implement basic agent registry/orchestrator
- ⭕ Set up communication model (orchestrator/peer-to-peer)

### 4. Agent Implementation
- ⭕ Implement core agent abilities (start with Communications Agent)
  - Notes: Start with Communications Agent
- ⭕ Integrate with external tools/APIs (email, calendar, etc.)
- ⭕ Add ability for agents to read from personal/ for context
- ⭕ Implement agent-to-agent collaboration

### 5. User Interaction
- ⭕ Design and scaffold web interface
- ⭕ Implement basic user-agent interaction (send/receive tasks, view results)
- ⭕ Add notifications and agent management features

### 6. Testing & Iteration
- ⭕ Write and run tests for agent abilities and interactions
- ⭕ Gather feedback and iterate on architecture and featuresnpx create-next-app@latest ai-personal-team --typescript --use-npm --no-tailwind --no-src-dir --app && cd ai-personal-team && npm install express axios dotenv react-query @types/express @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom
- ⭕ Document usage, contribution, and onboarding guides
