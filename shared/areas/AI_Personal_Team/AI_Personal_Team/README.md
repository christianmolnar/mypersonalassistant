## Key Requirements

- **Collaboration Model:** Document options for orchestrator vs. peer-to-peer, and requirements for agent-to-agent communication
- **Integration Points:** List APIs, platforms, and data sources (e.g., Schwab Trader API, health trackers, calendars, email, etc.)
- **Security & Privacy:** Define authentication, authorization, and data protection needs
- **User Interaction:** Requirements for web interface, notifications, dashboards, and direct agent chat
- **Extensibility:** Guidelines for adding new agents, skills, or integrations
- **Success Criteria:** Define what success looks like for you (metrics, outcomes, user experience)
