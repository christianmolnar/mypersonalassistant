# Collaboration Model Options

## Orchestrator-Based Model
- Central agent assigns tasks, coordinates workflows, and aggregates results.
- Pros: Easier to manage, clear control, easier to debug.
- Cons: Single point of failure, less flexible for emergent behavior.

## Peer-to-Peer Model
- Agents communicate directly, negotiate roles, and collaborate without a central controller.
- Pros: More resilient, scalable, supports emergent collaboration.
- Cons: Harder to coordinate, more complex communication logic.

## Hybrid Model
- Combination of orchestrator for high-level goals and peer-to-peer for specialized collaboration.

## Questions to Consider
- What level of autonomy should each agent have?
- How should conflicts or duplicate work be resolved?
- What are the security and privacy implications of each model?
