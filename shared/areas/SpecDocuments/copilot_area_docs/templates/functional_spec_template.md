# Functional Specification: <Title>

**ADO Feature Link:** <Feature ADO Link>
**Author(s):** <Names of Author followed by contributors>

## 1. Overview
<An overview of the feature to set the context of why it matters (problem/opportunity), the scope and the solution being recommended. From a process perspective, write this first, but unless you’ve done a lot of research, you may want to write this last.>

## 2. Customer Personas & Scenarios
<Use this section to add bulleted list of customer persona as well as Scenarios. Use cases concentrate on the users rather than the system/capabilities.>

### 2.1. Scenario/Use Case Description
<Add a description for the scenario(s)/Use Case(s) that are being addressed. A reader should be able to clearly understand the scenario and supporting details.>

**User Story:**
As a <XX user(s) (primary users of the use case)>, I need to be able to <XX requirement task/action (scope of the business/user need not capability or product solution)> so that I am able to <XX to achieve XX outcome (include brief description of the outcome/goal of the use case including metrics if applicable)>. 

### 2.2. Current Solutions & Limitations
<Are there any existing solutions to the problem? How do customers solve this today? What are the limitations of the existing approach? What are the pain points?>

## 3. Goals
<A bulleted list of goals of delivering functionality/experience. Write SMART goals.>

## 4. Non-Goals
<A bulleted list of any non-goals. Example: If there is expected functionality that a reader might assume is part of this scope, but has been explicitly cut, call it out here.>

## 5. Outcomes & Metrics
<In this section identify the type of outcome as Customer, Business or Engineering.>
<In this section identify and define the important metrics related to the feature. If the metric is new, also describe how it should be measured.>

## 6. Functional Requirements
<What feature functionality is required to deliver on the scenario. Leverage Scenario Focused Engineering (SFE) removing technology and focusing on the ‘what’ the user experience needs. List the requirements for each scenario along with the priorities starting with MVP and slowly adding more features.>
*(Priority definition: P0: critical, feature can’t ship without it. P1: important, would still ship without it. P2: nice to have.)*

| # | Requirement Description | Priority (P0/P1/P2) | Notes / Acceptance Criteria (High-Level) | Scenario Mapping |
|---|-------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------|
|   |                         |                     |                                          |                  |

## 8. Design and Engineering Considerations Checklist

| Criteria                                                                                                                               | Response (Yes/No) | Notes/Plan (Required if "Yes") |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Data Governance:** Does this feature involve new data ingestion or querying existing data sources?                                   |                   |                                |
| *Why: To ensure Data Governance, new data ingestion should leverage the CX Data Platform, and if that’s not possible need to at least have a waiver.* |                   |                                |
| **Reusability:** Does this feature leverage existing building blocks/services/components?                                              |                   |                                |
| *Why: Where applicable, we must leverage the existing building blocks instead of rebuilding capabilities.*                               |                   |                                |
| **Government Cloud (AGC):** Is this feature required to be available in Azure Government Cloud?                                        |                   |                                |
| *All new features must be available in AGC in < 30 days after public rollout unless a waiver is obtained.*                               |                   |                                |
| **Accessibility & Inclusivity:** Does this feature meet accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1 AA)?                                   |                   |                                |
| *Why: Accessibility and inclusive design are part of our promise to our customers and employees, and are critical to our mission to empower everyone.* |                   |                                |
| **Security & Privacy:** Does this feature introduce architectural changes requiring a thread model review or have privacy implications? |                   |                                |
| *Why: To ensure compliance with security and privacy policies.*                                                                        |                   |                                |
