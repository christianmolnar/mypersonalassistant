# Program Management Specification Template

**Document Status:** [Draft | In Review | Approved | Obsolete]
**Version:** X.Y
**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]
**Stakeholders:** [List key stakeholders, e.g., Engineering Lead, Marketing Contact, Support Lead]

*This document often starts as a "1-pager" to lay groundwork, capture key information, and guide initial costing. The 1-pager components (Executive Summary, Goals & Non-Goals, Scenarios, Prioritized Functional Requirements, Partners & Dependencies) should evolve and be expanded with the other sections to form this complete specification. It is not meant to be a separate document that lives alongside a full spec.*

---

## 1. Executive Summary
   *(The Executive Summary provides a succinct overview and will evolve from the 1-pager. It covers the "what" and the "why," steering away from the "how" initially.)*
   - **1.1. The Elevator Pitch:** State a summary of the experience at a very high level.
   - **1.2. Customer Focus:**
        - **1.2.1. Customer Segment & Persona:** Clear statement of the customer segment (e.g., Consumer, VSB, SMB) and target persona (e.g., IT Admin, end-user).
        - **1.2.2. Problem Statement:** What problem is the feature trying to solve? Be specific. Who is affected? Why is this problem important to them?
        - **1.2.3. Business Justification:** Why should we do this? (e.g., vision fit, customer data, market opportunity, competitive threat, required infrastructure).
        - **1.2.4. Strategic Alignment:** How does this align with the broader Microsoft strategy in this feature’s area?
   - **1.3. Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) Impact:** Which OKR(s) will be impacted by this feature and what is the expected business impact/contribution? (It’s okay for a feature not to be directly tied to an OKR if its value is clearly articulated, e.g., engineering excellence).

## 2. Goals & Non-Goals
   *(Clearly define what’s important for this feature, aligning with broader business goals and customer promises.)*
   - **2.1. Goals & Measures:**
        *(Goals should be specific, prioritized, and objectively measurable. Detail what the feature must or must not accomplish.)*
        - Goal 1: [Description]
          - Measure: [How success for this goal will be measured]
        - Goal 2: [Description]
          - Measure: [How success for this goal will be measured]
   - **2.2. Non-Goals:**
        *(Be explicit about what is beyond the scope of this feature/deliverable. These are things you are explicitly not doing or supporting. This is not an exhaustive "cut" list.)*
        - Non-Goal 1: [Description. Provide a high-level mitigation if it\'s something customers might expect.]
        - Non-Goal 2: [Description]

## 3. Scenarios
   *(A scenario is a story told from the customer’s point of view, explaining their situation and what they want to achieve. It includes a customer problem statement (before the feature) and describes the happy ending (after the feature). Focus on the experience (the ‘what’), not implementation details (the ‘how’). A good scenario: tells a narrative STORY, includes PERSONAL details, reveals deep INSIGHTS, shows how the feature ADDRESSES customer needs, includes EMOTIONS & context, and is IMPLEMENTATION FREE.)*

   **Scenario 1: [Scenario Title - e.g., As a {Persona}, I want to {Action} so that {Benefit}]**
   [Customer\'s situation and problem statement before the feature exists. Include personal details, insights, emotions, and context.]
   
   *<magic happens>*
   
   [Describe the "happy ending" after the feature is completed. Show how the feature addresses the customer\'s needs.]
   [Customer\'s positive emotional response and achieved benefit.]

   **Scenario 2: [Scenario Title]**
   ...

## 4. Proposed Solution Overview
   - **4.1. Solution Description:** Briefly describe the proposed solution at a high level. How does it address the scenarios?
   - **4.2. Key Features/Components:** List the major features or components of the solution.

## 5. Prioritized Functional Requirements (High-Level)
   *(This section lays out high-level requirements from the 1-pager, used for initial costing and prioritization. Detailed requirements will be expanded later or in a linked Functional Spec.)*
   *Priority definition: P0: critical, feature can’t ship without it. P1: important, would still ship without it. P2: nice to have.*
   | # | Requirement                                  | Priority (P0/P1/P2) | Notes / Acceptance Criteria (High-Level) |

   | 2 | [Example: Admins can configure setting X]    | P1                  |                                          |
   | 3 |                                              |                     |                                          |
