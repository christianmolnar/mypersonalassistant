- **[Templates](./templates/README.md):** Standardized templates for various types of specifications (Functional, PM, Technical).
- **[Guidelines](./guidelines/README.md):** Best practices, RDX-specific writing guides, review processes, and common pitfalls to avoid.
- **[Examples](./examples/README.md):** Curated examples of well-crafted specifications to provide inspiration and illustrate best practices.
