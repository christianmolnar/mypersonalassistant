# Workspace-MCP Documentation Index

This document serves as an index and summary of all files in the Tools/Workspace-MCP/copilot_area_docs/ folder, providing a quick overview of each document's purpose and when it should be used.

## MCP Documentation Files

### MCP_doc.md
- **Purpose**: Provides a comprehensive overview of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) client ecosystem.
- **When to use**: Reference this document when you need to understand which applications support MCP, their feature compatibility, and specific client details.
- **Key topics**:
  - Client feature support matrix (Resources, Prompts, Tools, Sampling, Roots)
  - Detailed descriptions of client applications with MCP support
  - Use cases and integration capabilities for each MCP client

### MCP_typescriptlib_doc.md
- **Purpose**: Contains detailed documentation for the MCP TypeScript SDK, including installation, usage examples, and core concepts.
- **When to use**: Reference this document when implementing or modifying the MCP server code in this workspace.
- **Key topics**:
  - SDK installation and quickstart guide
  - Core concepts: Server, Resources, Tools, and Prompts
  - Transport options (stdio, HTTP with SSE)
  - Testing and debugging information
  - Example implementations (Echo Server, etc.)

## Project Implementation Status

This workspace contains a work-in-progress implementation of an MCP server using the TypeScript SDK. The main implementation files are:

1. `Tools/Workspace-MCP/server.js` - The main MCP server implementation
2. `Tools/Workspace-MCP/enhancedTransport.js` - Custom transport implementation 
3. `Tools/Workspace-MCP/package.json` - Project dependencies and configuration

The current goal is to complete the implementation of a fully functional MCP server that can interact with MCP-compatible clients.

## Next Steps

When working with this project:

1. First, review the MCP_typescriptlib_doc.md for understanding the SDK capabilities
2. Reference MCP_doc.md to understand how clients will interact with your server
3. Use the server.js file as the main entry point for implementing new MCP server features
4. Consider both the stdio and HTTP/SSE transport options based on your integration needs

For questions related to MCP implementation specifics, refer to the appropriate documentation file as indexed above.
