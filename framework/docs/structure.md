# Repository Structure Guide

This document explains the organizational structure of the shared workspace.

## Top Level Organization

The repository is organized into these primary sections:

- **framework/**: Core framework components that define how the repository works (shared)
- **shared/**: Shared structure for all work areas (no personal/specific data)
- **personal/**: Personal workspace with specific task instances (gitignored, not shared)
- **.github/**: Repository configuration and Copilot instructions

## Framework Organization

The framework folder contains all the shared elements that define how the repository works:

- **templates/**: Standard templates for creating new areas and projects
- **tools/**: Shared utility scripts and tools used across different areas
- **docs/**: Documentation explaining how to use the repository structure

## Shared Structure 

Each area in the `shared/` folder follows this structure:

- A `copilot_area_docs/` folder with area-specific context
  - Contains a `main.md` file that summarizes all files in this directory
- Empty project folder structure templates (specific implementations go in personal)

## Personal Workspace

The personal folder contains your personal implementation of tasks:

- Organized with whatever folder structure the user wants - though if names match areas or tasks assume it's an instance of that area or task work.
- Contains your specific implementation files and data
- Has a `copilot_docs/` folder with your current tasks
